# Parallax Backgrounds
This is my implementation of parallax backgrounds from one of [frankz laboratory's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg7ibYWhjPI&t=1s&ab_channel=Frankslaboratory)

## Preview

## Insight
Parallax effect gives the illusion of space in a 2d setting. The varrying animation speed
makes the background feel as though some elements are far away, and some are near.
